## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Run `npm install` from the `client/` directory and from the `server/` directory  
Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory, if it does not exist  
In `.env`, set the base url of the homehost server  
###### **`client/.env`**
```env
REACT_APP_HOMEHOST_BASE = "http://localhost:5000"
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/"
REACT_APP_TMDB_BASE = "https://www.imdb.com/title/"
```  
Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory, if it does not exist  
In `.env`, set a working API key for TMDb API and Spotify Web API, set the media paths, and set tha base url of the homehost client  
###### **`server/.env`**
```env
TMDB_KEY = '<api_key>'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = '<client_id>'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = '<client_secret>'

MOVIES_PATH = '/path/to/movies/directory'
TV_PATH = '/path/to/tv/directory'
MUSIC_PATH = '/path/to/music/directory'

DATABASE_URL = 'file:./data/media.db'
CLIENT_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
```
If you dont have keys, you can request API authorization from Spotify at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/, and TMDb at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction  

### Naming conventions

Your media must appear in the locations set by `.env`. Each media must be in a unique location and cannot share the same directory path(s)  
üé• **Movies**  
```
<movies_path>  
- (subdirectory)?  
  - (movie_file_name <TMDb-movie-ID>) (.mp4|.mkv)  
```
üì∫ **TV**  
```
<tv_path>  
- (tv_show_directory_name <TMDb-tv-show-ID>)  
  - (S<season_number>E<episode_number> episode_file_name) (.mp4|.mkv)  
```
üéµ **Music**  
```
<music_path>  
- (album_directory_name <Spotify-album-ID>)  
  - ((<disc_number>-)?<track_number> track_file_name) (.mp3|.flac)  
```
Tracks not found on Spotify can be put in a directory titled `Unknown Album` sans disc/ track number  
```
<music_path>  
- Unknown Album  
  - (track_file_name) (.mp3|.flac)  
```

### Database

From `server/`, run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database and necessary migrations  
Run `npm run start-dev` to start the application in dev mode  
*homehost* scans the media paths and adds the files to the database  
Wait for the async job to finish generating metadata and save  
To explore all media data, run `prisma studio` to go to `http://localhost:5555`  
To reset the database and clear all data, run `npx prisma migrate reset`  

### Run

Run `npm run start-dev` from the `server/` directory to start the application in dev mode  
By default, the server port is `5000`, client port is `3000`  
Run `npm start` from the `server/` directory to start the application as prod  
By default, client and server will run on `5000`  
While running, *homehost* continuously saves and retrieves metadata for any media files that were added, moved or removed
